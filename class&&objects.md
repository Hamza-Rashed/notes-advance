## Hello everyone .. Today we will learn something beautiful and new in our course 401 :fire: :fire: .. Please have fun :blush: :sunglasses: :heart_eyes:


# Classes in python

Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.

Compared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.

# object in python 

Objects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object. This is known as aliasing in other languages. This is usually not appreciated on a first glance at Python, and can be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, tuples). However, aliasing has a possibly surprising effect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, dictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the benefit of the program, since aliases behave like pointers in some respects. For example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the implementation; and if a function modifies an object passed as an argument, the caller will see the change — this eliminates the need for two different argument passing mechanisms as in Pascal.

# How To Thinking Recursively ?? 

Problems (in life and also in computer science) can often seem big and scary. But if we keep chipping away at them, more often than not we can break them down into smaller chunks trivial enough to solve. This is the essence of thinking recursively, and my aim in this article is to provide you, my dear reader, with the conceptual tools necessary to approach problems from this recursive point of view.

Together, we’ll learn how to work with recursion in our Python programs by mastering concepts such as recursive functions and recursive data structures. We’ll also talk about maintaining state during recursion and avoiding recomputation by caching results. This is going to be a lot of fun. Onwards and upwards!

# Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

 If you haven't guessed from my three-part focus on pytest, I've been bowled over by the way this testing system has been designed. After years of hanging my head in shame when talking about testing, I've started to incorporate it into my code, including in my online "Weekly Python Exercise" course. If I can get into testing, so can you. And although I haven't covered everything pytest offers, you now should have a good sense of what it is and how to start using it.
Resources

    The pytest website is at http://pytest.org.
    An excellent book on the subject is Brian Okken's Python testing with pytest, published by Pragmatic Programmers. He also has many other resources, about pytest and code testing in general, at http://pythontesting.net.
    Brian's blog posts about pytest's fixtures are informative and useful to anyone wanting to get started with them.
