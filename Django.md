# What is Django?
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean pragmatic design. A Web framework is a set of components that provide a standard way to develop websites fast and easily. Django’s primary goal is to ease the creation of complex database-driven websites. Some well known sites that use Django include PBS, Instagram, Disqus, Washington Times, Bitbucket and Mozilla.

* URLs: process requests from every single URL via a single function, it is much more maintainable to write a separate view function to handle each resource. The URL mapper can also match particular patterns of strings or digits that appear in a URL and pass these to a view function as data.
* View: A view is a request handler function, which receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. Views access the data needed to satisfy requests via models, and delegate the formatting of the response to templates.
* Models: Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application’s data, and provide mechanisms to manage (add, modify, delete) and query records in the database.
* Templates: A template is a text file defining the structure or layout of a file (such as an HTML page), with placeholders used to represent actual content. A view can dynamically create an HTML page using an HTML template, populating it with data from a model.
