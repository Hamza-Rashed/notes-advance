# React L2 :

# Conditional Rendering
In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application. Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

# Lists and Keys
Lists are rendered inside components. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings.

# Forms
form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, itâ€™s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. 
# Lifting State Up
Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data, lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor works best for this.
