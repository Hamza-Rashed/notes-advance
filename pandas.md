## Hello everyone .. Today we will learn something beautiful and new in our course 401 :fire: :fire: .. Please have fun :blush: :sunglasses: :heart_eyes:

# Panda ::
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language. 

## Library Highlights

   * A fast and efficient DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing;

   * Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL databases, and the fast HDF5 format;

   * Intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data: gain automatic label-based alignment in computations and easily manipulate messy data into an orderly form;

   * Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets;

   * Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets;

   * Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for size mutability;

   * Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets;

   * High performance merging and joining of data sets;

   * Hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;

   * Time series-functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging. Even create domain-specific time offsets and join time series without losing data;

   * Highly optimized for performance, with critical code paths written in Cython or C.

   * Python with pandas is in use in a wide variety of academic and commercial domains, including Finance, Neuroscience, Economics, Statistics, Advertising, Web Analytics, and more.

## Mission

pandas aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.
