## Hello everyone .. Today we will learn something beautiful and new in our course 401 :fire: :fire: .. Please have fun :blush: :sunglasses: :heart_eyes:

# TDD with Python 
In layman’s terms, TDD recommends writing tests that would check the functionality of your code prior to your writing the actual code. Only when you are happy with your tests and the features it tests, do you begin to write the actual code in order to satisfy the conditions imposed by the test that would allow them to pass.

Following this process ensures that you careful plan the code you write in order to pass these tests. This also prevents the possibility of writing tests being postponed to a later date, as they might not be deemed as necessary compared to additional features that could be created during that time.

Tests also give you confidence when you begin to refactor code, as you are more likely to catch bugs due to the instant feedback when tests are executed.

# Recursion 

* When a function calls itself, it is known as a recursive function.

* Use of the function call stack allows Python to handle recursive functions correctly.

* Examples include factorial, Fibonacci, greatest common divisor, flattening a list of lists, and mergesort.

* We’ll think about how to hand-simulate a recursive function as well as rules for writing recursive functions.
