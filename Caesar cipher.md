# Caesar cipher
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

# usage 
The Vigenère cipher uses a Caesar cipher with a different shift at each position in the text; the value of the shift is defined using a repeating keyword. If the keyword is as long as the message, is chosen at random, never becomes known to anyone else, and is never reused, this is the one-time pad cipher, proven unbreakable. The conditions are so difficult they are, in practical effect, never achieved. Keywords shorter than the message (e.g., "Complete Victory" used by the Confederacy during the American Civil War), introduce a cyclic pattern that might be detected with a statistically advanced version of frequency analysis.

# Types
* Hashing: message into an unreadable string of text for the purpose of verifying the message’s contents, not hiding the message itself.
* Symmetric Cryptography: uses a single key to encrypt a message and then decrypt that message upon delivery
* Asymmetric Cryptography: uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography
* Key Exchange Algorithms: used to safely exchange encryption keys with an unknown party
