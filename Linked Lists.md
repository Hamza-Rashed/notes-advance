# Linked Lists
## What is a Linked List

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.

   * Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
   * Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
   * Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
   * Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
   * Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
   * Head - The Head is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
   * Current - The Current reference is a reference type of type Node that is currently being looked at. This node is traditionally used when traversing through a full linked list. When traversing, you typically reset the current to the head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.
